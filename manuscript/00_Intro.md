This isn't a normal switching to Linux book. hmm.. we are already off to kind of a cliche start aren't we? It's funny, everything different always starts by telling you how different it is; and boy oh boy have we produced a lot of different things. Different is the new normal. Let's try this again.

Everything you know about Linux is wrong! Well now, isn't that clever of me, by telling you all your preconceptions are wrong I've got your interest, at least for a moment, until you realize it was only a tagline.

Give me summary! Give me tl/dr. Give me how to! Give me top ten! Give me smashing of preconceptions! Give me question of the status quo!

Change my mind! Change my knowledge! Change my conceptions!


If you are looking for a quick pay off you wont find it inside. Actually, that is not true, you'll just have to look for it, 

It's not a how to book. There will be no step by step list of do that then do this. There will be no top ten summaries of the best free alternatives to  Microsoft OfficeNaKabobFontFoo ExcelPoop Spreadsheet 11. i

It's a journey book, it's a send of to the search for the best development environment. It's about my quest to find my way in a world full of OSes and different ways of doing things. I don't know where I'm going, what I will discover along the way, or what my final destination will be. I'm picking a direction at letting discovery be the momentum that drives me forward.

It's about a quest for something more, for something closer to perfection.

This is not a technical book, but some of it will take technique to read.
