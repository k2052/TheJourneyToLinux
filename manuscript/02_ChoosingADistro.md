Choosing a distro is a long and difficult process. First one has to visit the local distro store where you'll meet a adorkable girl covered in dsitro hair that will tell you all about the merits of distro A. Distro A won't poop on your GNOME and GNOME 3 is awesome. Now I know what you're thinking "I'ved GNOME 3" sucks. The hubavublub is all wrong, it's really awesome. Actually KDE is the best. KDE has sporks and spines, which will rewind your kinds and shuffle your winds. But wait Unity isn't so bad, searching your apps, documents and pictures of cats from the same sport? Man KDE uses that QT crap, who needs QT when you got unity.

I'm not going to advocate one distro over another. I'm choosing Ubuntu sure, but by the end of the book who knows, we might find ourselves using an os called minty dog chews. Why someone would name an OS minty dog chews is beyond me, but perhaps will discover there was a reason. Maybe by the end we will see like the Minty Dog Chew People.

Ubuntu is a starting place not the destination.
